# <u>FixMCStats</u>
Fabric mod that aims to fix some issues with the Minecraft statistics.ðŸ¤“

This is an unofficial NeoForge Port and I have limited scope for testing, please report it to me if something goes wrong.

If you are the original author of the mod, you can freely extract that Fork back into your project, I don't ask for anything.

## <u>Fixes</u>

## <u>Issue tracker</u>

When you open a ticket either to report a bug or for an enhancement request make sure that no other ticket already exists. 
Always separate your tickets one ticket by bug/request.

### Report an issue (with the mod) :

- No warranty is provided about the full functionality of the mod however bugs reports especially good ones are appreciated.
- Try to use a title that briefly describe the problem.
- Describe the problem and how to reproduce it.
- Join logs, crash report, screenshots or all other things that can help to illustrate your report or reproducing steps.
- Don't report a Minecraft bug as a bug.

### Want a Minecraft bug to be fixed by the mod ?

- No guarantee is provided for a patch to be added by the mod. A MC bug report is always analyzed in depth to ensure that a possible fix is aligned with behaviors that I believe to be close to vanilla based on comments in the Mojang Mojira and my own opinion.
- The bug must be linked to MC statistics.
- Don't ask for a bug which is a translation issue. I can barely talk in english imagine for all other languages MC supports.
- Always refers to an official Minecraft bug from the [official issue tracker](https://bugs.mojang.com/projects/MC/issues).
- The bug should occur on MC release versions not only on snapshots for being eventually fixed.
- Make sure the bug doesn't appear in the **Won't fix** section already.
